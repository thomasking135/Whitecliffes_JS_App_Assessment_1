<span style="color: green;">**Security-Focused Registration Process**</span>

The Kiwi Sports Apparel App prioritizes user security from the start. To access the app's features, users are required to register. During registration, the app performs a quick check to verify the user's identity based on their email address.

<span style="color: green;">**One-Time Token for Enhanced Security**</span>

Upon successful registration and confirmation of the user's existence, a one-time token is issued. This token is valid for a specific duration and serves as an extra layer of security. If the token remains unused within the specified timeframe, it automatically expires, ensuring that it must be regenerated for continued access.

<span style="color: green;">**Efficient Token Management**</span>

For users with an active account and a valid, unexpired token, seamless access to the app is granted. Tokens are carefully managed and only persist as long as they meet the criteria of being current and within the allowed usage window.

The Kiwi Sports Apparel App's registration and token system not only prioritizes security but also ensures efficient and secure access for its users.
